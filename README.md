Briefly summarize the requirements and goals of the app you developed. What user needs was this app designed to address?

The app is an inventory management application that was designed to be simple and allow users to track inventory quantity. The app included a notification system that would notify the user if the stock level is low and included a one-main page design to ensure the flow design was intuitive. 

What screens and features were necessary to support user needs and produce a user-centered UI for the app? How did your UI designs keep users in mind? Why were your designs successful?

The main screen displayed the list of inventory items and quantity. I designed a layout that included all the core components the application needed on one main page. Actions such as adding items, setting notifications, and editing items were logically placed and labeled, making it easy for users to perform tasks.

How did you approach the process of coding your app? What techniques or strategies did you use? How could those be applied in the future?

I approached app coding methodically, beginning with thorough requirement analysis and architectural planning. I ensured components were modular and adhered to best coding practices by including useful comments. 

How did you test to ensure your code was functional? Why is this process important and what did it reveal?

After adding new components, I made sure to run the application and conducted user testing to verify that it operated according to its intended functionality.

Considering the full app design and development process, from initial planning to finalization, where did you have to innovate to overcome a challenge?

The hardest challenge was to think of a design for the inventory main page. I do have a creative mind so it was difficult for me to draft a design that was user-friendly and not too simple. I drafted three different designs on paper before finally choosing one that I felt was appealing.

In what specific component of your mobile app were you particularly successful in demonstrating your knowledge, skills, and experience?

I believe I did well on my development of the Login page since I had previous experience in creating user credentials through database work on personal projects. I emphasized the use of suitable naming conventions for component IDs and ensured I wrote readable code.
